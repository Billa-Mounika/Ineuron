    "Q1) What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans) In Python,OOPs is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. \n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, Abstraction etc. in the programming. \n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. "

    "Q2) Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans) Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). We can use either __mro__ attribute or mro() method. "

    "Ans) \n",

    "Ans)The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called"
