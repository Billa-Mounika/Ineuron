    "#1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, def defined functions are commonly used because of their simplicity. The def defined functions do not return anything if not explicitly returned whereas the lambda function does return an object. The def functions must be declared in the namespace. The def functions can perform any python task including multiple conditions, nested conditions or loops of any level, printing, importing libraries, raising Exceptions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are one-line methods without a name or we can say anonymous Func They work practically the same as any other method in Python Lambdas differ from normal Python methods because they can have only one expression, can't contain any statements and their return type is a function object\n"
