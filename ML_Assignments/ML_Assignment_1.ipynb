    "2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "Ans. The following are some of the issues where Machine Learning can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Recognition: Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. The popular use case of image recognition and face detection is Automatic friend tagging suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech Recognition: While using Google, we get an option of Search by voice, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as Speech to text, or Computer based speech recognition At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",

    "Ans.\n",

Labels make that data specifically useful in certain types of machine learning known as supervised machine learning setups.\n",
    "The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then you use the trained model on the test set to predict the label values that are already known. "

We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function.
